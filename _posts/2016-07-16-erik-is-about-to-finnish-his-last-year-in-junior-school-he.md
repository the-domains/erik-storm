Erik is about to finnish his last year in junior school. He's like any other kid he assumes. That is until he incidently releases Fenris - The ancient norse wolf of destruction from his captivity in the realm of dreams.

Faced with Fenris growing destructive force Erik needs to make new friends and allies. Some of whom once used to be powerful norse gods, but now are dormant shadows of their former selfes. But the gods have been told that Fenris release is the start of Ragnarok and their part was written thousands of years ago. Before Erik can rely upon their help he needs to convince them that destiny is not unchangable
